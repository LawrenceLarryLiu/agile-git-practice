The article that I found very interesting is - [Innovative Thinking: Using the “Agile Mindset” to Improve Productivity](https://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/innovative-thinking-using-the-agile-mindset-to-improve-productivity-02168881). The author Jeanne Hardy, who is the CEO and founder of a business advisory firm in NYC, discusses how the "Agile Mindset" that originated from the software industry can be very useful in other disciplines as well. She discusses that Agile is a "philosophy of work" that people in fields like business, finance, and artistic/creative industry can use to approach their work. Beyond the fact that Agile has revolutionized information technology and greatly increased success rates and quality in software development, the spread of this philosophy and approach to other industries is another testament to its value and effectiveness.

## Comments from Larry Liu
I liked the idea of transparency behind each of the tasks in each sprint while in the "Agile Mindset". The work is divided into three sections: that which still needs to be done, that which is currently in progress, and that which has been completed. By making everything transparent and allowing team members to manually adjust the status of each job based on its completion, this methodology enables peers to comment on and review work as it's being completed so that they can catch any issues or problems before it's too late.
