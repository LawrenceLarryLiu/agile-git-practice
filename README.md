The article that I found very interesting is - [Innovative Thinking: Using the “Agile Mindset” to Improve Productivity](https://www.business2community.com/business-innovation/innovative-thinking-using-the-agile-mindset-to-improve-productivity-02168881). The author Jeanne Hardy, who is the CEO and founder of a business advisory firm in NYC, discusses how the "Agile Mindset" that originated from the software industry can be very useful in other disciplines as well. She discusses that Agile is a "philosophy of work" that people in fields like business, finance, and artistic/creative industry can use to approach their work. Beyond the fact that Agile has revolutionized information technology and greatly increased success rates and quality in software development, the spread of this philosophy and approach to other industries is another testament to its value and effectiveness.
